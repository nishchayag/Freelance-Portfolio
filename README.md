As my first real-world, production-grade application developed as a freelancer, this ReactJS portfolio website showcases not only my work but also my ability to integrate modern development tools effectively. Built on "ReactJs", the site uses "Tailwind CSS" for a highly responsive, streamlined and utility-first design approach. For UI components, I incorporated "Material UI" (@mui/material) along with @emotion/styled for elegant and flexible styling. Animations are powered by "react-spring/web" and "react-spring", providing smooth transitions and engaging motion effects, while "framer-motion" enhances interactivity throughout the interface. I also integrated "react-slick" and "slick-carousel" to create a sleek, interactive carousel in the project to showcase the customer reviews given to the client and their services. To add visual flair, I used "lucide-react", which brings in beautifully minimal icons. Altogether, this portfolio reflects my ability to craft visually appealing, performant, and modern web applications using a comprehensive set of front-end technologies.
